# Smart-Fan

This project was developed as part of the ELEC3300 course offered by HKUST. 

## Purpose

In our daily life, we often leave our fan running even when we're not there, leading to wastage of electricity. To overcome this, 
me and my partner developed a fan that would switch on only when it detected a user within 60cm of itself. Furthermore, it would change
its speed according to the distance between the user and the fan, reducing its speed as the user got closer.

##Resources

We made use of a base code provided to us in one of the labs. The code for distance detection is based on a youtube video found online 
which explained how the sensor works.
